== Description ==

Note is a simple and easy to use widget for editing bits of text, live, in your WordPress front-end Customizer. Add Notes into any sidebar to visualize how your copy will appear within the unique layout and design of your website. 

With Note, there's no more painful back and forth from the WordPress dashboard to the front-end of your site to refresh. Simply add your Note widget into a sidebar and begin typing. It's that easy.

Note is brought to you by the team at [Conductor Plugin](https://conductorplugin.com/). We're making content layout and display a cinch with [Conductor](https://conductorplugin.com/).

You must be in the front-end Customizer of your WordPress website. Once you're there, add the Note widget under sidebar settings.

Note was created so you could visualize the look & feel of your copy in the context of your website's design. The best way to experience Note is - do it live.
